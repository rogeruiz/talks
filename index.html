					<h1>Generic Tradmarks</h1>
					Comparing AJAX as a technology versus a term in the industry that helped move it forward.
					Responsive Web Design
					- Fluid Grid
					- Flexible Media
					- Media Queries

					3 front-end techniques

					That's it!

				</section>

				<section>
					This lead to Responsive Cure All and Linament Miracle Tonic

					People thought that RWD is all you need

					Others were more skeptical
				</section>

				<section>
					Responsive Layouts are just the tip of the iceberg
					--- Front end technique

					Feature Detection
					RWD in
					Per
					apis for the device
					content strategy
					conditional loading
					html5
					touch
					platform optimiz
					ergonomics
					--- All fundamental change
				</section>

				<section>
					RWD is the term

					Screw adaptive

					RWD is the generic term for creating multi-device web experiences

				</section>

				<section>
					Principles of adaptive design

					ubiquity
					flexibility
					performance
					enhancement
					future friendly
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Ubiquity</h3>
					The web was a desktop

					Now the web is everywhere

					It's much larger and diverse than it used to be.

					What is the web in the future????

					Web tweeting refridgerator haha

					Windsheild screen by Microsoft

					????? <= what else is coming just a year from now??

					<h2>The power of the web is its ubiquity!</h2>

					"THIS IS FOR EVERYONE"

					Stephanie Reiger "Diversity is not a bug, it is an opportunity"

					People still look at the web on a mobile device as crippled

					Mobile users will do anything and everything tht a desktop user will do.  It just needs to be presented in a diff way.

					x One Web!
					x Thematic Consistency!
					√ GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!

					<section>
						Does content parity trump all?
						YES

						Sometimes a desktop site on a mobile device makes sense.
					</section>

					<section>
						CONTEXT

						Quantitative vs Qualitative

						"On The Go" is still TRUE

						76% while waiting in line
						86% watching TV
						80% downtime
						38% on the toilet
					</section>

					<section>
						Mobile doesn't need to be on a pedestal
					</section>

				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Flexibility</h2>

					Specific device dimensions are madness. are nonsense.

					The web is inheriently fluid.

					ISH <= a tool by Frost which tests your site .

					EMBRACE THE SUISHINESS.™ Brad Frost

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Performance</h2>

					71% mobile site should load as fast or faster than desktop

					74% > 5 seconds people will leave

					You have 5 seconds of someone's time.

					1.3MB average webpage

					86% responsive sites send the same content to small screen and large screen users

						If your website is 15MB, it's not HTML5. it's bullshit
						Christian Heilman
					</section>

					<section>
						Even Obama's site is even too big
					</section>

					<section>
						Performance is invisible
						You can't mock it up in photoshop
						You can't figure it out ahead of time.

						Performance goes way too quickly into GEEKLAND.
						WHY?

						Performance isn't just a techinical BEST PRAC it's a design decision as well.

						Facebook taught us that with the HTML5 versus Native made a big impression on people.

						Good Performace is Good Design

					Enhancement

					RWD != One Size Fits All

					Progressive Enhancement

					Let's do Mobile First

					What are the constraints there?

					Fit your features on the smallest device and work up!

					It's not about building LCD experiences, it's about starting there!

					Use Modernizr!

					<section>
						Brief word about mobile web apps.

						2013, nobody has JS disabled! ~ Plenty of Devs

						JS Support isn't binary.

						It's not that JS can fail, it's that it will. Think errors! 3rd party or your own!

						Even Obama's site, because of the JS implemented navigation, failed.
					</section>

					<section>
						There are instances where Prog Enhan doesn't work... 

						Think Angry Birds as a text-based adventure.

						Or Nike iD as a form instead of an interactive image.
					</section>

					<section>
						Support and Optimization <= there is a difference!

						Lower devices are just trying to get to the content.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Future Friendly</h2>

					There is no such thing as being Future-Proof but we can be future friendly!

					Think of Google Glass and how that came out of left-field.

					<section>
						Focus

						We need to focus because if we don't as creators, our users will do it for themselves.

						Instapaper, Bittorrent, Ad Blockr, TiVo
					</section>

					<section>
						Make APIs not War

						Invest in your content!

						Don't just think of your site as a web publishing platform

						Our content should be like water, it should be able to go to more places.
					</section>

					<section>
						We don't know what will be going under the xmas tree. But that's the web in the future

						What we're dealing with now is like bootcamp for tomorrow's insanity ~ Brad Frost
					</section>

				<section>
					Some ideas from Frost on Multi Device Web Design

					<section>
						Navigation should be like a good friend. It should be there when you need them.

						Navigation shouldn't be that annoying friend though.
					</section>

					<section>
						Search form

						Searching is really important on mobile.

						Make sure to use the correct <input type="search"> element!
					</section>

					<section>
						Product Info!

						What is the user doing on the site?

						79% of people use their mobile device in stores.

					</section>

					<section>
						Product images?

						Carousels!
						Make sure you actually need one! <= seriously!
							- Pull up some stats and publish those stats
						Cycle through like-items.
						Only load what you need! <= lazy load
						BE EXPLICT WITH NAVIGATION
							- pagination dots are insufficient.
							- Brad's done enough user testing to know that people gloss over them.

					</section>

					<section>
						Product Form

						Use the correct <input type="number"> versus <input type="number" pattern="0-9">

						This is basically what this comes down to.
					</section>

					<section>
						Sharing Buttons

						Social Count by filamint group.
						Keep things snappy.
						Lazy load your social icons.
					</section>

					<section>
						Find nearby!

						Geo-location

						Getting information of things near the user

					</section>
					<section>
						Context!!!

						Old Context!
							- desktop users

						New Context!
							- Everything is connected.

					</section>

					<section>
						"Aggressive Enhancement" Prog Enhance

						Design the experience to be lightweight and offload the different content
					</section>

					<section>
						Scrolling

						3 use cases

							- going back thru time
							- through grouped items
							- deep dive into content

						We're always scrolling down through a singular content type

						This is not a good user experience.
					</section>

					<section>
						footer navigation

						it's not bad to be redundant.

						It allows users to pivot. Same as back to top.

						phone's make phone calls

						<a href="tel:+555-5555">555-5555</a>
					</section>

					<section>
						THIS STUFF IS HARD, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT.

					6 billion worldwide mobile subs

					It's a humbling stat
					4.5 bill w/o web v 2.4 bill w/ web

					What happens when 4.5 gets access?

					We're living through not one but two of humanity's greatest achievements.
					The web and mobile devices!
